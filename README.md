### booksearch.js

*Lines 1 - 43

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [webninjadeveloper](https://webninjadeveloper.com/react/build-a-react-book-search-app-using-google-books-api-v3-in-browser-using-typescript/) as shown below: 

```
import React, { useState } from "react";  
import axios from 'axios';  
import { Card } from 'react-bootstrap';  
function googleBooksSearch() {  
    const [book, setBook] = useState("");  
    const [result, setResult] = useState([]);  
    const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState("AIzaSyCqi37mzRrzkBrDZDb0BX9_IarX5iMOT88")  
  
    function handleChange(event) {  
        const book = event.target.value;  
        setBook(book);  
    }  
    function handleSubmit(event) {  
        event.preventDefault();  
        axios.get("https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=" + book + "&key=" + apiKey + "&maxResults=40")  
            .then(data => {  
                console.log(data.data.items);  
                setResult(data.data.items);  
            })  
    }  
    return (

export default googleBooksSearch

This code below was inspiration for the form on Profile.js. It is part of the Bootstrap library. - Geoffrey Belcher

<div class="form-floating mb-3">
  <input type="email" class="form-control" id="floatingInput" placeholder="name@example.com">

## Individual Work
## Individual Work
* Bryce Wiedemann - B00828649 - br664676@dal.ca
  * Files I created or modified
	1. server.js
	2. history.js
	3. navigation.js
  *  User History and Stats Feature
  I focused on creating the user history and stats. This feature entails the user clicking on the history and stats section of the navbar (My Account > History & Stats). This feature allows for a user to press the borrow button on the main page (homepage) and the book that borrow was pressed on will automatically be added to the database as a book that the user has read/is reading. The information that is added to the database and then pulled and displayed for the user to see the stats like books read in total, how many total pages, and approximately how many hours have been/would have been read (if the books were read). This is based on the average rate that i found people read at which is 1/2 page per minute. To do this i had to add functionality to the borrow button, aswell as create the API enpoints using mongoose/mongoDB to allow for the information to added/polled from the database.

We had some issues with the login feature so the username/ID is hardcoded as of the moment to "test@test.ca". This account does not have an official username to display on the user stats page and is just used to see the books added.

I also designed the navigation bar/header to allow users to navigate the page in a simple mannor.

* Geoffrey Belcher - B00798482 - gbelcher@dal.ca
  * Files I created or modified.
  1. server.js, added user api capabilities. Also worked on bug fixes for a while.
  2. Profile.js
  3. profile.css
  * Feature
  For this project, I am implementing a feature that allows the user to view a Profile page and add a review to a book. I originally wanted the feature to show recommendations for them, however I don't know how to make an algorithm to do that and also I think its a big beyond the scope of the project. I want the profile page to show stats about the user, show what reviews the user has on their profile page, and allow them to update their password.
  For this assignment, I've added the API functionality in `server.js` to add a user to the DB and to fetch user data by a specific email. As well, I've added a `Profile.js` file which renders the profile page, as well as a `addreview.js` file which allows the user to add a review which shows up on their page. I also spent a while trying to fix our dependancies and get the API in working state for me and my team.

* Yuchen Ye - B00883812 -yc786880@dal.ca
  * File I created
  1. server.js
  2. BookDetails.js (and css)
  3. Backend folder
  4. Filter.js (and css)
  * Feature I made
In this group project, I implemented MongoDB link (server.js) and each book review (BookDetails.js).

In the previous proposal and assignment. I am mainly responsible for the implementation of filter function and review function. But later in the programming, my team used the    Google api to replace the database as the book display function. Since I am not familiar with the Google api usage, I cannot complete the filter function. Therefore, I fully implemented the review function. As the user clicks through each book, BookDetails puts the author and biography of each book on top. And add a form below that allows users to enter their name and comments. When the form is submitted, user comments are uploaded to the database and displayed below. You can search for one in the search bar and click on the first book to see reviews.

Another feature I've done is connect to mongoDB. I used some dependencies to connect (e.g. mongoose,express) and then created the schema and model for Review below. Use the get method and post method in YouTube 5. If you want to check your database connection, you can view my review collection by typing "local host:8080/api/review" into the URL bar

  * File I created
  1. Message.js
  2. Recover.js
  3. Reset.js
  4. Resetsuccess.js
  5. server.js (later part as marked)
  6. Login.js
  7. Register.js
  8. schemas.js
  9. CSS files of all above.

> In this group project, I implemented registeration, login, credentials recover/reset and user authentication. 
> In the previous assignments and proposal, I was always doing the authentication and authorization features. But in previous works, I use self-implemented API for retrieving contents from server. In this assignment, I tried to use auth0 to implement better authentication. However, all the funstions are tested working on the auth0 testbed (data can actually go into our database and retrieved).
> these API partially working, exist some mongodb connection issue, throw 404 error sometime for no reason.

> the testbed and authentication tempelate code from: https://manage.auth0.com/

* Kaushik Dhamodaran - B00855259 - ks695041@dal.ca
  * Files created or modified:
  1. bookSearch.js
  3. bookSearch.css
  * Feature
  For this project, I integrated the Google Books API to fetch and display data for given books using the google books API. I was also responsible for the search and display features which would connect to Google Books and retreive book titles from the website. In addition, I aided with the book borrowing feature wherein users can borrow books that they have searched for and add it to their profile, which Bryce then added backend functionality to so it could integrate with his history feature. These features allow for a user to search for books and add it to their collection, though ideally this API would integrate with any library's API that would want to use this website to offer their customers a more unified experience when it comes to borrowing books
